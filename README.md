# client-auth-example
Example code for implementing client side auth.


Client-side certificate authentication allows you to verify with a CA (Certificate Authority) the identity of a client via the SSL/TLS protocol. The example code given in this repo shows you how you can enable client-side certs with a few lines in node.js.
